### Abstract

Kinetic facades possess aesthetic expressiveness and environmental responsiveness, aligning with the principles of 
low-carbon architecture. Current kinetic facades primarily rely on three-dimensional movement, which are characterized 
by complex structures and distributed drives, resulting in monotonous form, low robustness, and high costs. This paper 
focuses on the design of two-dimensional kinetic facades, proposing a hinged tessellation generation method based on the 
duality principle. First, the paper discusses the value and principles of applying dual graphs in HT, and then proposes 
a method of generating HT by adding hinged plates. Then, the operation process for different tessellation types is 
elaborated upon. Finally, a conceptual design is proposed to illustrate the potential of this method on kinetic facades. 
The method proposed in this paper is applicable to all uniform tessellations and Voronoi tessellations, capable of 
generating an infinite variety of planar expandable structures with small spatial thickness, simple structures, stable 
movements. Additionally, these structures can be driven to expand by a single driving point, enabling continuous 
adjustment in response to the requirement. It has significant application value in fields such as architectural and 
decorative design, structural design, mechanical design, industrial product and graphic design.
