### 摘要

本发明公开了一种体积可变的均匀凸多面体装置设计方法,用平面铰接镶嵌构造均匀凸多面体的各面,在各面顶点上施加形心指向顶点方向的力,让各顶点同速度同时展开,获
得了具有创新性和体系性的可膨胀体设计方法。本方法能快速构建一系列体积可变的均匀凸多面体。均匀凸多面体由于其高度对称性与各面为正多边形的特性,在实际的工作
与生活中有广泛的应用场景。本设计方法形态简洁,无需额外框架,并且兼具体积可膨胀的技术优点和艺术表现力,在艺术品设计、可动建筑设计、机械设计以及工业设计领域
都有较高的应用潜力。

### Abstract

The invention discloses a design method of a uniform convex polyhedron device with variable volume, which uses plane 
hinge mosaic to construct each surface of the uniform convex polyhedron, applies force with centroid pointing to the 
vertex direction on each surface vertex, and leads each vertex to be unfolded at the same speed, thus obtaining an 
innovative and systematic design method of the expandable body. The method can quickly construct a series of uniform 
convex polyhedrons with variable volumes. The uniform convex polyhedron has wide application scenes in actual work and 
life due to the high symmetry and the regular polygon characteristic of each surface. The design method has the 
advantages of simple form, no need of additional frames, specific volume and expandability, and artistic expression, 
and has higher application potential in the fields of artwork design, movable building design, mechanical design and 
industrial design.
